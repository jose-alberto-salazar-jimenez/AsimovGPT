**Short for "Asimov's Foundation Universe GPT" Version 1.0**

Here you can find the code I used to enable a simple and humble "gpt" tool to (try yo) answer queries/questions about the "Foundation Universe" (Robot, Galactic Empire and Foundation books/series) written by, the "GOAT" of Sci-Fi in my opinion, Isaac Asimov.

The following figure shows in nutshell the "logic" of the tool.

And here's a screenshot of the tool working.
